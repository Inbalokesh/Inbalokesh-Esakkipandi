<h1> Inba Lokesh </h1>

I am <B>Inba lokesh</B> (<i>born 8th November 2003</i>), Completed my schooling, and working as a <strong>student in freshworks</strong>.

<h2> Early life and family </h2>

<p>My name is E.Inba lokesh and I was born on 8th November 2003 in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, to <big>Mr.Esakki Pandi and Mrs.Annapoorani</big>. I studied in ST. Lourdes Matrication school 
and Pon Vidhyashram group of CBSE schools in Chennai(Injambakkam).</p>

<p>And I have one younger brother named<b> E.Akilesh</b>. Currently studying in school. And my father does DTP work on bond and also teaches typerwriting and basic computer. My mother
was a computer teacher (1997 - 2016) working in private instutions.</p>

<h2>History and School life</h2>
<p>I was born at a Government hospital in Thiruvanmiyur, Chennai. My birth was a disaster because I was just <mark>1.25 Kg at my birth</mark>, doctor said it is tough to be alive. But 
after few months inside the incubator, I was becoming better under many conditions like couldn't eat properly, the food does not digest properly, being in the womb position for a long 
time without moving, and after all conditions my mother saved my life. Although facing many difficulties like often becoming sick, I still face problems on my body condition. But my 
mother supported me well.</p>

<ul><b><li>2007-2009: Kindergarden Stage</li></b>
<p>I completed my LKG and UKG in St.Lourdes Matric school, I have a lot of good memories there, I actually forgot my class teacher name, she is the best teacher who changed my life.</p>

<b><li>2009-2021: Primary and Higher Secondary Stage</li></b>
<p>A decade was filled with beautiful memories, started with my <small>first standard</small>, I still remember the first day of my new school, feeling very <sup>shy to speak</sup> 
with others and not seeing anyone's face, being so <i>pathetic</i>. After few months I got new friends, fun overloaded, awesome days of my life. Till <small>fifth standard</small>
it was fine, after that it actually changed my perspective of everything. Started to explore a lot and playing lot of games, collecting cards, pen fight, bet matches, cricket, football,
video games, etc. It was going well till my 9th standard.</p> 
<p>The debt problem started and the school love life ended at the same time. The life started teaching me new things, I was trying to be normal and the borad 
exams were nearing I got decent marks and then, at the end of 11th standard corona started. A big disaster for the whole world, people can identify us as corona batch. Passed my 12th
and couldn't able to join the college due to personal problems and started to work for few months with my neibhour uncle Mr.Vijay, A very good hearted person, who taught me many life
lessons and new skills. He helped me to overcome many things and taught me photography,editing, and art.</p>

<b><li>2021-present stage</li></b>
<p>While I was working, I was searching in youtube to learn coding and new skills then I come to know about FWSA, After that I applied for the entrance exam, And I still can't 
understand how I ended up here. A very big opportunity in my life and I have to be true for that and utlize them properly.</p>

Currently working and learning as a student in <ins>FWSA</ins>.</ul>

<h2> My Dreams and Hobbies</h2>
<ol><b><li>DREAMS</li></b><p>There is one dream still alive from my childhood is to become a<ins> PILOT</ins>. I really dont remember why and how I choose that, but it became my goal,
and there are lot more big dreams. I would really wonder how only two peoples can control a big plane, then I understood that many people work down for a plane to fly up. I want to
travel a lot inside my state because there are many historic and beautiful places here we actually doesn't take them so serious. And learn lot more on our culture and history of tamil 
people. Want to learn things from its core and understand them properly. I feel more happy when my brain works. And I want to use my brain for the atmost level. And do some good and 
useful things for our country, give knowledge to people. If that is given properly everything would change. And even I would like to invent new material or things that helps all the
people.
</p>

<b><li>HOBBIES</li></b>
<p>My hobbies are playing football and cricket, solving rubix cube, playing sudoku, hearing music and also learning small new things, watching Youtube, used to draw something which I 
love while seeing.</p></ol>

<big>THANK YOU</big>
